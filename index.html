        <h2>Celebration and traditions</h2>
        <p>Today's Saint Patrick's Day celebrations have been greatly influenced by those that developed 
            among the Irish diaspora, especially in North America. Until the late 20th century, Saint Patrick's Day 
            was often a bigger celebration among the diaspora than it was in Ireland.[15]
            Celebrations generally involve public parades and festivals, Irish traditional music sessions (céilithe), 
            and the wearing of green attire or shamrocks.[8] There are also formal gatherings such as banquets and dances, 
            although these were more common in the past. Saint Patrick's Day parades began in North America in the 18th century 
            but did not spread to Ireland until the 20th century.[18] The participants generally include marching bands, 
            the military, fire brigades, cultural organisations, charitable organisations, voluntary associations, youth groups, 
            fraternities, and so on. However, over time, many of the parades have become more akin to a carnival. 
            More effort is made to use the Irish language, especially in Ireland, where the week of Saint Patrick's Day is "Irish language week".
            Since 2010, famous landmarks have been lit up in green on Saint Patrick's Day as part of Tourism Ireland's 
            "Global Greening Initiative" or "Going Green for St Patrick´s Day".[19][20] The Sydney Opera House and the Sky Tower 
            in Auckland were the first landmarks to participate and since then over 300 landmarks in fifty countries across the globe 
            have gone green for Saint Patricks day.[21][22]
            Christians may also attend church services,[7][9] and the Lenten restrictions on eating and drinking alcohol are 
            lifted for the day. Perhaps because of this, drinking alcohol – particularly Irish whiskey, beer, or cider – has become an integral 
            part of the celebrations.[7][8][10][11] The Saint Patrick's Day custom of "drowning the shamrock" or "wetting the shamrock" 
            was historically popular, especially in Ireland. At the end of the celebrations, a shamrock is put into the bottom of a cup, 
            which is then filled with whiskey, beer, or cider. It is then drunk as a toast to Saint Patrick, Ireland, or those present. 
            The shamrock would either be swallowed with the drink or taken out and tossed over the shoulder for good luck.

        <h2>Green Clothes</h2>
        <p>The colour green was further associated with Ireland from the 1640s, when the green harp
            flag was used by the Irish Catholic Confederation. James Connolly would later describe this flag. 
            prior to the 1916 Easter Rising, as representing "the scared emblem of Ireland's unconquered soul". 
            Green ribbons and shamrocks have been worn on St Patrick's Day since at least the 1680s. 
            The Friendly Brothers of St Patrick, an Irish fraternity founded in about 1750, adopted green 
            as its colour. However, when the Order of St. Patrick—an Anglo-Irish chivalric order—was 
            founded in 1783 it adopted blue as its colour, which led to blue being associated with St Patrick. 
            During the 1790s, green would become associated with Irish nationalism, due to its use by the United 
            Irishmen. This was a republican organisation—led mostly by Protestants but with many Catholic 
            members—who launched a rebellion in 1798 against British rule. Ireland was described as the 
            "the Emerald Isle" for the first time in print in "When Erin First Rose" (1795), a poem by co-founder 
            of the United Irishmen William Drennan, which stresses the historical importance of green to the 
            Irish.[47][48][49][50] The phrase "wearing of the green" comes from a song of the same name, which
            laments United Irishmen supporters being persecuted for wearing green. The late nineteenth and early 
            twentieth centuries have seen the re-emergence of Irish cultural symbols, such as the Irish Language, 
            Irish mythology, Irish folklore, and the colour green, through the Gaelic Revival and the Irish Literary Revival which 
            served to stir Irish nationalist sentiment. The influence of green was more prominently observable 
            in the flags of the 1916 Easter Rising such as the Sunburst flag, the Starry Plough Banner, and the
            Proclamation Flag of the Irish Republic which was flown over the General Post Office, Dublin together 
            with the Irish Tricolour. When Ireland did achieve its independence in 1922, the first act by the new 
            Saorstát Éireann (Irish Free State) government was to order all the post boxes to be painted 'Saorstát 
            green' (as it was described), under the slogan "Green paint for a green people";[51][52] in 1924, the 
            government introduced a green Irish passport for Irish citizens, and it would remain this colour until 
            the introduction of the burgundy coloured European Passports in 1985.[53][54][55] Throughout these centuries, 
            the colour green and its association with St Patrick's Day grew.

        <h2>Saint Patrick's Day Around The World</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ireland
                <p>Saint Patrick's feast day, as a kind of national day, was already being celebrated 
                    by the Irish in Europe in the ninth and tenth centuries. In later times, he became 
                    more and more widely seen as the patron of Ireland. Saint Patrick's feast day 
                    was finally placed on the universal liturgical calendar in the Catholic Church due t
                    o the influence of Waterford-born Franciscan scholar Luke Wadding[59] in the early 1600s. 
                    Saint Patrick's Day thus became a holy day of obligation for Roman Catholics in Ireland. 
                    It is also a feast day in the Church of Ireland, which is part of the worldwide Anglican Communion. 
                    The church calendar avoids the observance of saints' feasts during certain solemnities, 
                    moving the saint's day to a time outside those periods. St Patrick's Day is occasionally 
                    affected by this requirement, when 17 March falls during Holy Week. This happened in 1940, 
                    when Saint Patrick's Day was observed on 3 April to avoid it coinciding with Palm Sunday, 
                    and again in 2008, where it was officially observed on 15 March.[60] St Patrick's Day will 
                    not fall within Holy Week again until 2160.[61][62] However, the popular festivities may still 
                    be held on 17 March or on a weekend near to the feast day.

                    In 1903, St Patrick's Day became an official public holiday in Ireland. This was thanks to the Bank Holiday 
                    (Ireland) Act 1903, an act of the United Kingdom Parliament introduced by Irish Member of Parliament James O'Mara. 
                    O'Mara later introduced the law which required that public houses be shut on 17 March after drinking got out of hand, 
                    a provision that was repealed in the 1970s.

                    The first St Patrick's Day parade in Ireland was held in Waterford in 1903. The week of St Patrick's Day 
                    1903 had been declared Irish Language Week by the Gaelic League and in Waterford they opted to have a procession 
                    on Sunday 15 March. The procession comprised the Mayor and members of Waterford Corporation, the Trades Hall, 
                    the various trade unions and bands who included the 'Barrack St Band' and the 'Thomas Francis Meagher Band'. 
                    The parade began at the premises of the Gaelic League in George's St and finished in the Peoples Park, 
                    where the public were addressed by the Mayor and other dignitaries.[65][66] On Tuesday 17 March, 
                    most Waterford businesses—including public houses—were closed and marching bands paraded as they 
                    had two days previously. The Waterford Trades Hall had been emphatic that the National Holiday be observed.

                    On St Patrick's Day 1916, the Irish Volunteers—an Irish nationalist paramilitary organisation—held parades 
                    throughout Ireland. The authorities recorded 38 St Patrick's Day parades, involving 6,000 marchers, almost 
                    half of whom were said to be armed. The following month, the Irish Volunteers launched the Easter Rising 
                    against British rule. This marked the beginning of the Irish revolutionary period and led to the 
                    Irish War of Independence and Civil War. During this time, St Patrick's Day celebrations in Ireland were muted, 
                    although the day was sometimes chosen to hold large political rallies. The celebrations remained low-key after 
                    the creation of the Irish Free State; the only state-organized observance was a military procession and trooping 
                    of the colours, and an Irish-language mass attended by government ministers. In 1927, the Irish Free State 
                    government banned the selling of alcohol on St Patrick's Day, although it remained legal in Northern Ireland. 
                    The ban was not repealed until 1961.

                    The first official, state-sponsored St Patrick's Day parade in Dublin took place in 1931. 
                    On three occasions, parades across the Republic of Ireland have been cancelled from taking place 
                    on St Patrick's Day, with all years involving health and safety reasons. In 2001, as a precaution to the 
                    foot-and-mouth outbreak, St Patrick's Day celebrations were postponed to May and in 2020 and 2021, as a 
                    consequence to the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the St Patrick's Day Parade was cancelled outright. 
                    Organisers of the St Patrick's Day Festival 2021 will instead host virtual events around Ireland on their 
                    SPF TV online channel.


                    A St Patrick's Day religious procession in Downpatrick, where Saint Patrick is said to be buried
                    In Northern Ireland, the celebration of St Patrick's Day was affected by sectarian divisions. 
                    A majority of the population were Protestant Ulster unionists who saw themselves as British, 
                    while a substantial minority were Catholic Irish nationalists who saw themselves as Irish. 
                    Although it was a public holiday, Northern Ireland's unionist government did not officially observe 
                    St Patrick's Day. During the conflict known as the Troubles (late 1960s–late 1990s), 
                    public St Patrick's Day celebrations were rare and tended to be associated with the Catholic community. 
                    In 1976, loyalists detonated a car bomb outside a pub crowded with Catholics celebrating 
                    St Patrick's Day in Dungannon; four civilians were killed and many injured. However, some Protestant 
                    unionists attempted to 're-claim' the festival, and in 1985 the Orange Order held its own St Patrick's Day parade.
                    Since the end of the conflict in 1998 there have been cross-community St Patrick's Day parades in towns throughout 
                    Northern Ireland, which have attracted thousands of spectators.

                    In the mid-1990s the government of the Republic of Ireland began a campaign to use St Patrick's Day to showcase Ireland and its culture.</p>
